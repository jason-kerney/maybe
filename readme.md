# "Maybe" #

## RJK.Maybe Library Overview ##

## Introduction

The `RJK.Maybe` library is an F# implementation of the Maybe monad and related functional programming constructs. It provides types and functions to safely handle optional values, reducing the need for null checks and exception handling in your code.

## Features

- **Maybe Type**: Represents optional values, encapsulating the presence or absence of a value.
- **Maybe Monad**: Enables monadic operations for chaining computations that may fail.
- **MaybeList, MaybeSeq**: Utilities for working with lists and sequences of optional values.
- **Operators**: Custom operators for more expressive functional code.
- **Base Types**: Foundational types used throughout the library.

## Project Structure

- `Maybe.fs` â€“ Core Maybe type and functions
- `MaybeMonad.fs` â€“ Monad implementation and helpers
- `MaybeList.fs` â€“ List utilities for Maybe
- `MaybeSeq.fs` â€“ Sequence utilities for Maybe
- `Operators.fs` â€“ Functional operators for Maybe
- `BaseTypes.fs` â€“ Supporting types

## Usage Example

```fsharp
open RJK.Maybe

let tryParseInt (s: string) =
    match System.Int32.TryParse(s) with
    | true, v -> Some v
    | false, _ -> None

let result =
    tryParseInt "42"
    |> Maybe.map ((*) 2)
// result = Some 84
```

## Getting Started

1. Reference the `RJK.Maybe` library in your F# project.
2. Open the `RJK.Maybe` namespace.
3. Use the provided types and functions to handle optional values safely.
